## 3) Category Breakdown

- Unit tests: 39
  - Scheduler (12), ParallelFor (12), HazardTracker (15)
- Integration tests: 7
  - Scheduler + HazardTracker (7)
- Platform/primitive tests: 10
  - Fiber (Windows-focused)
- Performance/benchmark-style assertions (subset of above): 8
  - WorkStealing (4), ParallelFor (4)

Note: Performance tests are structured not to hard-fail with small regressions; thresholds are tolerant to avoid flakiness across hardware.

---

## 4) Coverage Gaps (Critical Only)

- Job priority scheduling behavior is not enforced by the scheduler yet (by design). Tests only validate acceptance, not ordering. Marked as technical debt, not a blocker.
- No explicit tests for job cancellation (API not present). If cancellation is added later, tests should validate: cancel before start, cancel mid-queue, idempotency, and interactions with hazard tracking.
- Comm layer async integration is validated indirectly via compile-time integration and runtime behavior of the Job System; there are no direct Comm+Jobs integration tests. Optional enhancement (not critical for Phase 2 scope).
- Fibers are validated for creation/deletion and thread conversions, but do not exercise actual fiber-switch scheduling paths (SwitchTo); acceptable given Phase 2 scope, can be expanded if fibers are used in Phase 3 blocking ops.

---

## 5) Acceptance Criteria Coverage (Phase 2 Roadmap)

- Work-stealing scheduler with per-thread queues and stealing: Covered (WorkStealingTest.*) ✔
- ParallelFor correctness and scaling: Covered (ParallelForTest.*) ✔
- Hazard tracking semantics (multi-reader/single-writer) and conflict prevention: Covered (HazardTrackerTest.* + Integration tests) ✔
- Integration into engine core (init/shutdown, usage safety): Covered by SchedulerTest.* and integration tests ✔
- Stability under exceptions and concurrent submissions: Covered (SchedulerTest.ExceptionHandling, ConcurrentSubmission) ✔
- Performance characteristics demonstrated via qualitative tests: Covered with tolerant thresholds ✔

Conclusion: All Phase 2 acceptance criteria are covered by tests.

## 6) Recommendation on Test Suite Completeness

- Overall completeness: HIGH
- Blocking gaps: NONE
- Suggested enhancements (non-blocking):
  1) Add priority scheduling tests once implemented
  2) Add optional Comm+Jobs integration tests (async publish paths)
  3) Add a simple fiber-switch test if fiber scheduling is leveraged in Phase 3

The current suite (63 tests) provides robust coverage to proceed to Phase 3 with confidence.
